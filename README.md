1. Open the extracted folder in **VS Code**.
2. In the terminal, create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   .\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
   ```

### Install Dependencies
Once inside the virtual environment, install Django:
```bash
pip install django
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the `core` directory where the `manage.py` file is located:
```bash
cd core
```

### Migrate the Database
Apply database migrations using the following commands:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
python manage.py runserver
